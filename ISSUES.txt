Overall
-------

-Must verify wiring more.  All inputs and outputs should be connected.
-Must verify placement overlaps.  Right now, par outputs "error 30", which is pretty confusing.

Specific
--------

-cCollection.  Check the 'realization' of cfg pairs - data may contain CR's...  Also, note:
loc:SLICE_X0Y0<CR> other stuff fails.  CR is a menace here.

Syntax changes
--------------
Accomodate initalization file for RAMs
